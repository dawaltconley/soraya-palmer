Prismatic and dazzling, Palmer's debut entrances with its 
stories-within-stories structure and loving portrayal of two sisters coming 
into their own power while grappling with family secrets and tales untold. 
Anansi and other folkloric figures and deities of their Jamaican Trinidadian 
heritage weave throughout the novel, transforming from teller to teller, from 
one generation to the next—at times haunting or healing, seductive or 
terrifying. Palmer's ever-rippling prose also shifts deftly—from magical to 
macabre, playful to tender, always with compassion for all.
