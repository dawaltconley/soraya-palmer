What happens to stories that are born of another land? When they migrate 
multiple times and across multiple generations? Soraya Palmer’s ambitious and 
passionate debut, _The Human Origins of Beatrice Porter and Other Essential 
Ghosts,_ is a thoughtful exploration of these questions.... This is a book 
written with the gods of storytelling in mind; it highlights what stories can 
do—that it’s not just the stories that evolve with each telling, but we 
ourselves who are rearranged too.
