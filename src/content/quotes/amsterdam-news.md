In Soraya Palmer’s The Human Origins of Beatrice Porter and Other Essential 
Ghosts, the fantastical plot flowers more like a century-old fable than a 
standard work of fiction, made up of colorfully strange characters.... One 
cannot help but experience curiosity about this tale of two sisters who begin 
to live very different lives as they grow older. If you’re interested in 
colorful African American folklore, this book is unlikely to disappoint.
